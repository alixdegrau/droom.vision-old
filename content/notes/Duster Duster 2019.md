**I'm Lost**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9RpalVr9h0

```
Don't you know I'm lost?
Don't you know I'm lost without you here
Without you near

Don't you know I'm lost?
Don't you know I'm lost without you here
Without you near

Don't you know I'm lost without you here
Without you near
```

**Summer War**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ukUQgct8FQ

```
The summer war is upon us now
We'll have to take our things and go
End is coming to take us home, alright

Watch the buildings coming down
Nothing's coming to save us now
Bring the horror to the front tonight

Devil's arming to the teeth
Come the phantom time to reap
Pray the Lord your soul to keep you now

Ah the ground, it's falling out
Summer shadow takes control
Let it go 'cause nothing matters now

Watch the buildings coming down
Nothing's coming to save us now
Heaven's coming to take us home, alright

The summer war is upon us now
We'll have to take our things and go
All the heavens falling down tonight
```

**Hoya Paranoia**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18mz2tzTA1Y

```
The hoya paranoia of the committee man
The phantom me
Most benevolent of the quickening
An inquiry
Just hold it together man
This is your last chance
```

**Ghoulish**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gVSY3cImQM

```
This listlessness
I'm sneaking off
Call me back
A cloud-filled world where dust is slow
Seems foolish

Once behind the earth moon night
Still shaking
Clutching me, your hands can't find the way back home
Fate like glass, we're breaking up
Feels ghoulish
Emptiness
But no one cares death made time
```

**Ghost World**

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Noyu8Hf28

```
Where did you go?
So far from home
You're all alone

Where is your ghost world?
Into nowhere
Fall from under
Are you gone now?

Where did you go?
So long ago
You left alone
You lost your ghost world
Come back home now
On forever
Lost and haunted

Ghost world
Into nowhere
Home forever
In your ghost world
```
